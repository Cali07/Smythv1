# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) Docs

Welcome to the technical documentation for the Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) core.

The SRE is a sophisticated, production-ready runtime platform designed specifically for AI Agents. Think of it as the "Operating System for AI Agents"â€”a robust foundation that handles the complexities of AI agent execution, allowing developers to focus on building intelligent behaviors rather than infrastructure.

This documentation provides a deep dive into the internal architecture and design of the SRE. For information on building agents, please see the SDK documentation.

## Core Concepts

To understand how SRE works, start with these fundamental concepts.

-   **[Core Architecture](./architecture.md)**: Learn about the SRE's kernel-inspired design, its lifecycle, and the flexible connector model that powers its modularity.
-   **[Security Model](./security.md)**: Understand the foundational Candidate/ACL system that enforces secure, multi-tenant resource access throughout the environment.
-   **[Component System](./components.md)**: Discover how Components act as the building blocks of agent behavior and how they are orchestrated by the runtime.

## Subsystems

SRE's functionality is partitioned into several discrete subsystems. Each is responsible for a specific domain of the runtime's capabilities.

-   **[Subsystem Overview](./subsystems/index.md)**: Get a high-level view of all the major subsystems and how they fit together.
    -   **[Agent Manager](./subsystems/agent-manager.md)**: The heart of agent execution.
    -   **[Memory Manager](./subsystems/memory-manager.md)**: Manages agent state, context, and caching.
    -   **[LLM Manager](./subsystems/llm-manager.md)**: The abstraction layer for all LLM providers.
    -   **[IO Subsystem](./subsystems/io.md)**: The gateway to all external services like storage and databases.
    -   **[Security Subsystem](./subsystems/security.md)**: Manages secrets and identity.

## Extend SRE

Learn how to add your own functionality to the SRE.

-   **[Custom Components](./extend/Components.md)**: Guide to creating new agent components.
-   **[Custom Connectors](./extend/Connectors.md)**: Guide to creating new service connectors.
-   **[Custom Subsystems](./extend/Subsystems.md)**: An overview of adding new top-level subsystems.
