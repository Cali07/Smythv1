# SmythOS SRE Examples

This directory contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to use the SmythOS SRE (Smyth Runtime Environment) and its various features.

Each example is a standalone script that can be run to see a specific part of the system in action.

## Running Examples

You can run any example using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`. Simply provide the path to the example file you want to run.

### With NPM

```bash
npm start <path_to_example.ts>
```

### With PNPM

```bash
pnpm start <path_to_example.ts>
```

### With Yarn

```bash
yarn start <path_to_example.ts>
```

For instance, to run an example located at `01-agent-code-skill/01-prompting.ts`, you would execute:

```bash
npm start ./01-agent-code-skill/01-prompting.ts
```
