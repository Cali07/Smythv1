# SmythOS SRE Monorepo - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Overview

This is the **SmythOS SRE (Smyth Runtime Environment)** monorepo - an advanced agentic AI platform that provides a comprehensive runtime environment for building and managing AI agents. The system includes LLM management, vector databases, storage, security, and agent orchestration capabilities.

## Monorepo Structure & Package Manager

-   **Package Manager**: PNPM (required) - use `pnpm` commands for all package management
-   **Workspace Structure**:
    -   `packages/core` - Main runtime library (@smythos/sre)
    -   `packages/sdk` - Developer SDK (@smythos/sdk)
    -   `packages/cli` - Command line interface
    -   `examples/` - Example implementations and demos

## Naming Conventions & Standards

### File Extensions

-   `.service.ts` - Top-level subsystem services
-   `.class.ts` - Classes and connectors/managers
-   `.utils.ts` - Utility function collections
-   `.helper.ts` - Task-specific helper objects
-   `.handler.ts` - Event handlers
-   `.mw.ts` - Middleware

## Critical Reminders

⚠️ **ALWAYS USE PNPM** - This is a pnpm workspace. Never suggest npm or yarn commands.
⚠️ **MONOREPO STRUCTURE** - Always consider workspace context when suggesting changes or running commands.
